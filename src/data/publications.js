    abstract:
      'Word-of-mouth (WOM) has proven a valuable marketing tool for acquiring new customers and companies frequently invest in referral reward programs to incentivize their current customers to spread word-of-mouth. Previous work has documented that referred customers are more valuable than those who join through other venues. We propose a new, and rather critical, advantage of encouraging referrals − referrals are contagious. Using field data from 41.2 million customers, two preregistered lab experiments, and one field experiment, we find that referred customers make more referrals than non-referred customers. The difference in referrals persists after controlling for the level of match between the customer and firm, individual-level differences, and social network effects. To explain how referral contagion arises, we find that it is partially driven by customers\' perception that referring is more socially appropriate if they were originally referred to the same product. In a field experiment, we show that reminding customers that they joined through a referral boosts referral behavior by 20−27%. These results advance our understanding of the social and psychological motives that contribute to referral decisions and illustrate that promoting referrals is substantially more valuable than previously estimated.',

      'Machine learning tools such as neural networks are increasingly applied in marketing and economics to learn complex relations in data. The learned relations allow machines to perform various tasks, such as recognizing objects from images or recognizing emotions from speech. This paper explores using a neural net to learn the relation between data (moments) and the parameter values of a structural economic model, so that it can "recognize," or estimate, these parameter values from the data (moments). We train the neural net with the datasets generated by the structural model under different parameter values. The neural net can be trained to give not only the point estimates of parameters but also their statistical accuracy. We show this Neural Net Estimator (NNE) converges to meaningful and well-known limits when the number of training datasets is sufficiently large. NNE does not require computing integrals over the unobservables in the structural model. Thus, it is suitable for models where such integrals are costly in MLE/GMM. We benchmark NNE in two Monte Carlo studies. NNE is able to achieve high estimation accuracies under very light estimation costs.',

    abstract:
      "We study the design of dealer compensation policy in the indirect auto lending market, where most lenders give dealers the discretion to mark up interest rates. To protect consumers from potential discrimination by the dealer discretion, several banks switched to a new compensation scheme by fixing the markup as a percentage of the loan amount. We document that the market share of these banks responded positively (negatively) in the consumer segment where the policy increased (decreased) the interest rate — a reversal of the usual demand curve — which highlights the influence of dealers on the bank choice for financing loans. Accordingly, we develop and estimate an empirical model that allows for dealer–consumer bargaining, which depends on both the dealers' and the consumers' utility. Based on the estimation results, we explore alternative compensation policies that also eliminate dealers' discretion. We show that a lump-sum compensation that pays dealers a fixed dollar amount per loan dominates the current policy for the banks in terms of gaining market share. This is because dealers' equivalent markup rates would better align with their bargaining power. Our study highlights the importance of accounting for the interests and bargaining power of middlemen in designing a compensation scheme.",

    abstract:
      "What is the value of verified employment data in consumer lending? We study this question using a data set covering all employment verification inquiries to Equifax. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we analyze the changes in applicants' loan outcomes after their employers join Equifax's digital verification system, which provides lenders with an efficient way of accessing the (employer-) verified employment data in auto loan applications. Holding the employment status constant, we find that the availability of digitally verified data significantly expands credit access: the loan origination rate increases by 35.5% on average, and is more significant among deep subprime (146%) and subprime consumers (44%). The interest rates charged on these loans rise only slightly. The expanded credit access also benefits lenders, with an estimated 19.6% increase in profit. This is because the benefit of the market expansion effect dominates the cost of a higher delinquency risk among the expanded loan portfolio. Our results suggest that, besides seeking new data sources, managers and policy makers should also consider ways to extract more value from existing data.",

    abstract:
      'This paper studies price bargaining when both parties have left-digit bias when processing numbers. The empirical analysis focuses on the auto finance market in the United States, using a large data set of 35 million auto loans. Incorporating left-digit bias in bargaining is motivated by several intriguing observations. The scheduled monthly payments of auto loans bunch at both $9- and $0-ending digits, especially over $100 marks. In addition, $9-ending loans carry a higher interest rate, and $0-ending loans have a lower interest rate. We develop a Nash bargaining model that allows for left-digit bias from both consumers and finance managers of auto dealers. Results suggest that both parties are subject to this basic human bias: the perceived difference between $9- and the next $0-ending payments is larger than $1, especially between $99- and $00-ending payments. The proposed model can explain the phenomena of payments bunching and differential interest rates for loans with different ending digits. We use counterfactuals to show a nuanced impact of left-digit bias, which can both increase and decrease the payments. Overall, bias from both sides leads to a $33 increase in average payment per loan compared with a benchmark case with no bias.',

    abstract:
      "This article studies how receiving a bonus changes consumers' demand for auto loans and their risk of future delinquency. Unlike traditional consumer products, auto loans have a long-term impact on consumers' financial state because of the monthly payment obligation. Using a large consumer panel data set of credit and employment information, the authors find that receiving a bonus increases auto loan demand by 21%. These loans, however, are associated with higher risk, as the delinquency rate increases by 18.5%–31.4% depending on different measures. In contrast, an increase in consumers' base salary will increase their demand for auto loans but not their delinquency. By comparing consumers with bonuses with those without bonuses, the authors find that bonus payments lead to both demand expansion and demand shifting on auto loans. The empirical findings help shed light on how consumers make financial decisions and have important implications for financial institutions on when demand for auto loans and the associated risk arise.",

We demonstrate these results both through descriptive difference-in-difference regressions and a duration-dependent hidden Markov model we develop. We find that the program increases customer value by almost 30% over a five-year horizon, which is considerably larger than has been previously found for non-tiered loyalty programs. Most of the impact of the loyalty program comes through attrition: we show that the program's reduction in attrition accounts for more than 80% of the program's total lift, whereas increased frequency accounts for less than 20% of the program's lift. The program's lift is highest for least and most frequent automatic members, who experience reductions in attrition rates after joining the program. The impact of the loyalty program on spending per visit is negligible.",

    abstract:
      "This paper empirically investigates how marketers can retarget consumers who have searched online but did not purchase, based on their search behaviors. To infer the relationship between search activities and preferences, we estimate a structural search model that characterizes the consumer search process. We propose an estimator similar to the Geweke-Hajivassiliou-Keane estimator to evaluate the likelihood function. The proposed estimator makes recursive draws from truncated distributions that arise because of the observed search and choice behaviors in an optimal sequential search model. The recovered preferences are used to improve retargeting strategies demonstrated through a series of counterfactuals. Results show a substantial heterogeneity in responses to retargeting among consumers who exhibited different search behaviors. By contrast, the heterogeneity among consumers based on other characteristics (e.g., age, gender) is moderate. We consider two counterfactual marketing strategies: sending out coupons redeemed upon purchasing and sending seller recommendations that reveal the offering of recommended sellers. We find that although both strategies help increase the conversion rate, seller recommendations are more effective than coupons, suggesting the importance of providing consumers with the sellers' information for retargeting. We also show that a pricing mechanism such as an auction that makes the seller self-select to participate will improve the effectiveness of retargeting. Finally, online retail platforms can benefit both sellers and consumers by providing sellers with the information on consumers' search behaviors.",

      'It is well-documented that many mortgage borrowers make sub-optimal financial decisions by failing to refinance when interest rates are low, despite large potential savings. This paper studies the effectiveness of TV advertising on mortgage refinancing decisions. Using six years of mortgage origination and advertising data, we quantify the impact of TV advertising on consumers\' decisions to refinance their mortgages, as well as their choice of lenders. We find that TV advertising significantly increases the category-level demand for refinancing (i.e., market expansion effect) and influences the choice of lenders (i.e., business stealing effect). Interestingly, advertising can also benefit competing lenders through the market expansion effect. Beyond the analysis of ad quantity, we investigate the heterogeneous effects of ad content by leveraging zero-shot classification with a pre-trained large language model. We find that ads that highlight low mortgage rates and potential savings are the most effective in increasing both the category and brand-level demand. For policymakers and mortgage lenders, our findings suggest that advertising can be an effective tool to promote refinancing activities and offer practical guidance for designing advertising content.',

      'Recommender systems are essential for content-sharing platforms by curating personalized content. To evaluate updates to recommender systems targeting content creators, platforms frequently rely on creator-side randomized experiments. The treatment effect measures the change in outcomes when a new algorithm is implemented compared to the status quo. We show that the standard difference-in-means estimator can lead to biased estimates due to recommender interference that arises when treated and control creators compete for exposure. We propose a \'recommender choice model\' that describes which item gets exposed from a pool containing both treated and control items. By combining a structural choice model with neural networks, this framework directly models the interference pathway while accounting for rich viewer-content heterogeneity. We construct a debiased estimator of the treatment effect and prove it is n‾√-consistent and asymptotically normal with potentially correlated samples. We validate our estimator\'s empirical performance with a field experiment on Weixin short-video platform. In addition to the standard creator-side experiment, we conduct a costly double-sided randomization design to obtain a benchmark estimate free from interference bias. We show that the proposed estimator yields results comparable to the benchmark, whereas the standard difference-in-means estimator can exhibit significant bias and even produce reversed signs.',

      "We explore pre-training estimators for structural econometric models. The estimator is 'pre-trained' in the sense that most computations and effort occur once during its construction. Subsequent applications of it to estimate different datasets require little computation costs or effort. The estimation relies on a neural net to recognize structural model's parameter from data patterns. This paper focuses on a sequential search model that is known to be hard to estimate. We evaluate our pre-trained estimator on 11 real datasets. The estimation takes seconds to run and shows high accuracy. We provide it at pnnehome.github.io. More generally, pre-trained estimators make structural models more accessible and easier to apply. They can also facilitate privacy-preserving estimation because they need only aggregate data patterns.",

    abstract:
      'This paper examines the impact of racial minority representation on advertising effectiveness. We do this by first assembling data on 10 million mortgage refinance loans, along with data on TV advertisements for mortgage refinance. We construct a measure of minority representation from video ads using computer vision techniques, and extract additional video and transcript features from the advertisements using a variational autoencoder and a text embedding model. We then apply a Double Machine Learning model to estimate how the minority representation in ads affects which lender consumers choose for their refinancing, while controlling for high-dimensional image and text features, as well as a rich set of fixed effects. We find that ads with higher minority representation are more effective in driving consumer choices: as the minority share in ads increases from 15% to 25%, the advertising elasticity increases from 0.037 to 0.042 (a relative increase of 14%). This effect is more pronounced among minority borrowers but is also positive among White borrowers. Across the political spectrum, minority representation has a larger impact among liberal-leaning consumers. In addition to our observational study, we conduct a pre-registered lab experiment (N=2,796) where we manipulate the race of the actors using generative AI technology. The results are consistent with those from our observational study, providing further causal evidence for our findings. We discuss potential mechanisms driving these results, as well as the implications of our findings.',

A simple experiment, reminding referred customers of their referral origin, increased successful referrals by 21%, highlighting the potential for leveraging referral psychology to boost program effectiveness. These findings call for businesses to re-evaluate their investment in referral programs, considering the amplified potential of referred customers.
