  bio: `<strong>Zhenling Jiang</strong> is an Assistant Professor of Marketing at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. Her research program bridges substantive inquiries into <strong>consumer financial markets</strong> with methodological innovations that integrate <strong>machine learning and econometrics</strong>. She specifically investigates how market frictions—such as behavioral biases, information asymmetry, and intermediary incentives—shape outcomes in high-stakes sectors like auto loans and mortgages. These real-world challenges drive her to develop <strong>scalable empirical tools</strong>, including neural network estimators, that can process unstructured data while maintaining the essential ability to simulate policy counterfactuals. Ultimately, her work seeks to promote <strong>market efficiency and financial equity</strong> by providing a more rigorous understanding of modern market dynamics.`,
