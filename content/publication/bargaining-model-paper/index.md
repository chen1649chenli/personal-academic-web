abstract: 'This paper studies price bargaining when both parties have left-digit bias
  when processing numbers. The empirical analysis focuses on the auto finance market
  in the United States, using a large data set of 35 million auto loans. Incorporating
  left-digit bias in bargaining is motivated by several intriguing observations. The
  scheduled monthly payments of auto loans bunch at both $9- and $0-ending digits,
  especially over $100 marks. In addition, $9-ending loans carry a higher interest
  rate, and $0-ending loans have a lower interest rate. We develop a Nash bargaining
  model that allows for left-digit bias from both consumers and finance managers of
  auto dealers. Results suggest that both parties are subject to this basic human
  bias: the perceived difference between $9- and the next $0-ending payments is larger
  than $1, especially between $99- and $00-ending payments. The proposed model can
  explain the phenomena of payments bunching and differential interest rates for loans
  with different ending digits. We use counterfactuals to show a nuanced impact of
  left-digit bias, which can both increase and decrease the payments. Overall, bias
  from both sides leads to a $33 increase in average payment per loan compared with
  a benchmark case with no bias.'
