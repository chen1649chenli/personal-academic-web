abstract: This article studies how receiving a bonus changes consumers’ demand for
  auto loans and their risk of future delinquency. Unlike traditional consumer products,
  auto loans have a long-term impact on consumers’ financial state because of the
  monthly payment obligation. Using a large consumer panel data set of credit and
  employment information, the authors find that receiving a bonus increases auto loan
  demand by 21%. These loans, however, are associated with higher risk, as the delinquency
  rate increases by 18.5%–31.4% depending on different measures. In contrast, an increase
  in consumers’ base salary will increase their demand for auto loans but not their
  delinquency. By comparing consumers with bonuses with those without bonuses, the
  authors find that bonus payments lead to both demand expansion and demand shifting
  on auto loans. The empirical findings help shed light on how consumers make financial
  decisions and have important implications for financial institutions on when demand
  for auto loans and the associated risk arise.
